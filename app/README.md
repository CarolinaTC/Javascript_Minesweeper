**Hello everyone! 👋🏼**

I hope you are well.

I want to thank you for the opportunity to participate in this challenge, I learned a lot and it was a lot of fun!

To make it I used as inspiration 3 fonts that I usually follow:

> EduRise, The Coding Train(my favourite) and Traversy Media with Ania Kubow.

It was great because I got to learn a lot about recursion and use a lot of new javascript methods.

I kept it simple, but I plan to work on this project afterwards, as it motivated me a lot and was great for identifying some of my weaknesses as a junior.

Thanks again! 😊

Have a nice day! 
Let's keep in touch!😉
